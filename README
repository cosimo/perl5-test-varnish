Test-Varnish

Varnish is a high performance reverse proxy.

Test::Varnish allows you to perform tests against a varnish server,
asserting that a given resource (URL) is cached by varnish or not.

See it as a sort of Test::More extension to test Varnish.
This can be useful when you want to test that your varnish setup
and configuration works as expected.

Another use for this module would be to poll random webservers to
discover who is using Varnish.
